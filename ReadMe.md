Notes on Reinforcement Learning

Why do we want to add reinforcemencent learning to the model
    -takes too long
    -uses too much space

Use monte carlo cfr and only play to certain depth and gives result of that path

- make a nn to run the subgames
- use gradient formula to get learning algorithm
- run proper probability functions to test the ability of algo
