Just playing around with using reinforcement learning to reduce the search space for imperfect information games

About: 
- Algorithm for solving imperfect information games with reinforcement learning of public belief states
- Utilized Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization to find Nash equilibrium for 2 player zero sum games

TODO:
- run probability functions to test the ability of algo
